The _alt-3_ website uses two external services:

- [mathjax.org](https://mathjax.org) to display mathematical content
  (formulas and equations)

- [statcounter.com](https://statcounter.com) to record and count
  visits to individual pages at _alt-3.uk_, and to provide us with
  statistical summaries of those visits.
  
Each of these services sets a single cookie (if cookies are currently
allowed in your web browser) --- as detailed below.
	Neither of these cookies stores personal
data about you.

In particular,
   our use of [statcounter.com](https://statcounter.com) is configured such
    that **the full IP address of your computer is not recorded**, and also
    such that **no tracking is done of your individual browsing behaviour**.

Our aim is to keep the use of external services and related
   cookies to the minimum possible, and to explain it clearly here.
   **If you are uncomfortable with any aspect of this, though, please do not
   use the _alt-3_ site**.
