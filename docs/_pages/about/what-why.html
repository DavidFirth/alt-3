<h2>More informative football league tables</h2>

<p>The <strong>alternative league tables</strong> presented here at <em>alt-3.uk</em> use the principled method of Firth and Turner (2017), which ranks teams during the season in such a way that the strength of each team's opponents to date is taken properly into account (as well as each team's number of matches played, at home and away).</p>  

<p>The key to the method's success is to extend the well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model" title="Wikipedia page, opens in a new window or tab">Bradley-Terry model</a> in a way that is tailored specifically to the 3-1-0 points system, so that any difference between the alternative league table and the 'usual' league table is due entirely to the haphazard differences among teams' playing schedules.  Such differences are of three main kinds:
<ul>
 	<li>differences in the number of matches played;</li>
 	<li>differences in the proportion of matches played at home;</li>
 	<li>and, most crucially, differences in the strength of opposition that each team has faced so far.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>An alternative league table is <strong>not a prediction!</strong> The alternative table compares the performance of teams in the league season so far, in a coherent way that is designed to be more informative than the usual ("points in the bag") league table.</p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>

<p>The <em>alt-3</em> methodology is the work of:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://warwick.ac.uk/dfirth" title="David Firth's home page, opens in a new window or tab">Professor David Firth</a>, who works in the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick, and also at the Alan Turing Institute in London.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Researcher in statistical methodology.</li>
	<li>Fellow of the British Academy; awarded the Guy Medal in Silver by the Royal Statistical Society.</li>
	<li>Published research includes development of the <a href="http://warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling" title="U Warwick page on exit polling, opens in a new window or tab">election-day exit-poll method</a> that has been highly successful since its inception, and used jointly by BBC, ITV and Sky for their election-night coverage since 2005.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.heatherturner.net/" title="Heather Turner's home page, opens in a new window or tab">Dr Heather Turner</a>, who is an international statistical consultant based in the UK, and an Associate Fellow of the Department of Statistics at the University of Warwick.

	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
The <em>alt-3</em> method emerged as a (pleasing, and unexpected!) by-product of our joint work on the widely used <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BradleyTerry2/index.html" title="CRAN page, opens in a new window or tab"><em>BradleyTerry2</em></a> software package, which forms part of a larger research project at the University of Warwick that was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.</p>

<h2>Why the name "alt-3"?</h2>

<p>The <strong>alt</strong> part is for either "alternative league table" or "adjusted league table".  The <strong>3</strong> relates to the specific points system that's used in modern football leagues: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_points_for_a_win" title="Wikipedia page, opens in a new window or tab">three points for a win</a>, and one point to each team for a draw (or tie).</p>


<a name="leagues-included"></a>
<h2>The leagues included here</h2>

<p>Our initial aim is to compute and display the alternative table, at least weekly during the playing season, for some of the most prominent national football leagues. If it turns out that there is substantial interest in what we're doing, we might consider including more leagues when time permits it.</p>

<h2>A double link with Coventry!</h2>

<p>There's a cute, double link with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry">City of Coventry</a> in all this. The <a href="http://warwick.ac.uk" title="Warwick University home page, opens in a new window or tab">University of Warwick</a>, where the research that underpins <i>alt-3.uk</i> was done, is located in Coventry.  And the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Hill" title="Wikipedia page, opens in a new window or tab">Jimmy Hill</a>, former BBC <em>Match of the Day</em> presenter who was instrumental in introducing three points for a win, was a highly successful Manager (i.e., Coach) &mdash; and, later, Managing Director &mdash; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_City_F.C." title="Wikipedia page, opens in a new window or tab">Coventry City FC</a>.</p>
