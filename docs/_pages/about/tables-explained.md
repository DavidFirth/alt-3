Each *alt-3* ranking takes proper account of each team's **schedule strength** ---
that is, whether they have played (on average, to date) unusually 'easy' or
'hard' matches.

This includes the strength of the opponents played so far, and also 
any imbalance in the numbers of matches played at home and away.  (The 'home
advantage' effect in many major football leagues can be substantial.)

The *alt-3* table displays two new columns.  We say just briefly here 
what each of those columns refers to.  For (quite a bit!) more detail, 
see [the mathematical method explained](./the-maths/).

### The two columns are as follows:

- **sched**, the assessed 'schedule strength' for each team.  This measures how
difficult a schedule each team has had, since the start of the season.  An 
*average* 
schedule strength would be zero. 
A team that has a strongly *negative* schedule strength
has faced unusually weak opposition and/or has played more matches at home than 
away from home; and vice-versa for *positive* schedule strength.  
Teams that
have schedule strength far from zero are likely to be ranked differently in the 
*alt-3* table than in the 'standard' kind of table based on accumulated 
league points.  So 
the *sched* value helps to explain what is happening,
whenever we see such changes in league-table position.

- **Pts\|m**, the 'adjusted points total after *m* matches' for each team. The value
of *m* used in the table is the largest number of matches so far played by any
team in the league.  For teams that have played *m* matches, the Pts\|m is just
the accumulated league points plus the team's schedule strength to date.  If a team has
a game in hand, that is properly 
accounted for by using the team's projected points-per-match
across a fully balanced schedule. (In such instances we 
deliberately do *not* predict the outcome of the game in hand!
Remember, the *alt-3* table aims only to reflect teams' performances to date --- it
is not a prediction.)


**Every *alt-3* league table ranks the teams 
according to each team's adjusted points total.**


-----

It really must be emphasized that an *alt-3* table is **not a prediction**.
The *strength* value
and its *adjusted points per match* representation are designed
specifically to measure the relative performance of teams to date --- that is, to 
*represent faithfully what has happened*, rather than to predict 
what will happen in the future. 

(A good *predictive* model would
most likely need to take into account much more information than
simply the match results seen already within the current season.)
