Each *alt-3* ranking takes proper account of each team's **schedule strength** ---
that is, whether they have played (on average, to date) unusually 'easy' or
'hard' matches.

This includes the strength of the opponents played so far, and also 
any imbalance in the numbers of matches played at home and away.  (The 'home
advantage' effect in many major football leagues can be substantial.)

The *alt-3* table displays three new columns.  We say just briefly here 
what each of those columns refers to.  For (quite a bit!) more detail, 
see [the mathematical method explained](./the-maths/).

### The three columns are as follows:

- **s**, the strength of each team.  Average strength is 1. Teams that are 
stronger --- as evidenced only by their match results in the present season 
--- have strength values larger than 1; and weaker teams have 
correspondingly smaller values of *s*.

- **aP/M**, the 'adjusted points per match' for each team. This is directly 
related to the strength, *s*. Stronger teams are expected to do better across
the whole season; and the *aP/M* value indicates each team's 
likely points-per-match
tally at the end of the season, on the assumption that all teams will continue
to perform just as well (or badly) as they have done so far. 

**Every *alt-3* league table ranks the teams 
according to their assessed strength**, or
*equivalently* **according to each team's adjusted points per match.**

The *third* new column in each *alt-3* table is:

- **sched.s**, the assessed 'schedule strength' for each team.  This measures how
difficult a schedule each team has had, since the start of the season.  An 
*average* 
schedule strength would be zero. 
A team that has a strongly *negative* schedule strength
has faced unusually weak opposition and/or has played more matches at home than 
away from home; and vice-versa for *positive* schedule strength.  
Teams that
have schedule strength far from zero are likely to be ranked differently in the 
*alt-3* table than in the 'standard' kind of table based on accumulated 
league points.  So 
the *sched.s* value helps to explain what is happening,
whenever we see such changes in league-table position.

Finally, it should be noted that an *alt-3* table is **not a prediction**.
The *strength* value
and its *adjusted points per match* representation are designed
specifically to measure the relative performance of teams to date --- that is, to 
*represent faithfully what has happened*, rather than to predict 
what will happen in the future.  (A good *predictive* model would
most likely need to take into account much more information than
simply the match results seen already within the current season.)
