This is the
     **final _alt-3_ table for the 2017--2018 Premier League season**.  It
agrees perfectly with the official league table --- exactly as it should do, at the end of the season!

The next update
here will be the new season's _alt-3_ table (i.e., 2018--19 season).
Its first appearance of the new season is planned for
    **Tuesday 2nd October 2018**,
   once 7 full rounds of Premier League matches have been played.
   After that, the table will again be updated weekly.
