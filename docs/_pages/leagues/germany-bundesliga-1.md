Below is the _alt-3_ table as it stood at the end of last season. 

The new season 2020--21 presents a new and interesting chellenge: the previously stable phenomenon of _home advantage_, which it had been possible to model with just a single parameter for each league, looks very different this season (for perhaps obvious reasons). A revised _alt-3_ method will handle the change in a very general way; but (as of early December 2020) we're still testing the new method before publishing a new _alt-3_ league table here.  Apologies again for the long delay!  It should be worth the wait in the end --- please follow [@footymath](https://twitter.com/footymath) on Twitter to hear when it's ready.
