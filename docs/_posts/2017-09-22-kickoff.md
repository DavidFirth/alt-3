We're online at last!

I have just posted the 
[first of many regular *alt-3* league tables](/leagues/england-premier-league).  Right now it's only the English Premier League that's covered,
but various other major leagues across Europe will follow soon.

We are still working on various details of the website, so
do let me know if you see anything here (within reason!) that
could be improved.

Go straight to the 
[alternative Premier League table](/leagues/england-premier-league).
