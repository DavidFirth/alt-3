The *alt-3* [EFL Championship table](/leagues/england-championship) 
appeared for the first time this week.  I hope people will 
enjoy it! 

The strength of competition in the Championship keeps
things interesting, in terms of league standings.

Here I will just pick out a couple of aspects that might interest people.

## Fulham

Fulham currently stand at 4th in the official league table, but
they are **8th** (narrowly behind Brentford) in the _alt-3_ table.

The reason is that Fulham have faced a relatively easy fixture list up to
now; and their six remaining matches up to the season's halfway point include
tough away matches at Swansea, Preston and Brentford, and finally the
home match against second-placed Leeds. The _alt-3_ table allows for all that,
in a mathematically coherent way.

To see Fulham's current schedule-strength chart, just click on
the name "Fulham" in the 
*alt-3* [EFL Championship table](/leagues/england-championship)

## Blackburn Rovers

Blackburn's fixture schedule so far has been pretty average in aggregate,
but their schedule-strength chart is **weirdly different** from that
of every other team in the league (and in fact is different from every
schedule-strength chart that I have ever seen!)

- [Blackburn's current schedule-strength chart](/leagues/england-championship/schedule-strength-Bla/)

Most schedule-strength charts, in this or any other league, 'snake' slowly from
week to week through the season. But Blackburn's fixtures instead have a pronounced
zig-zag pattern. In the first half of this season, Blackburn's matches against 
(this season's) relatively low-ranked opponents tend to be always 
_home_ matches.  So
Blackburn's fixture schedule repeats a simple pattern:
a relatively easy match at home followed by a _much_ 
harder match away.  Hence the **zig-zag pattern** that we see in Blackburn's
schedule-strength chart.
