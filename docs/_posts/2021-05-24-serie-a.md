On April 19th I made a blog post under the heading [Serie A: Napoli and Benevento doing better than the official table shows](/2021/04/19/serie-a/).  At that time, the _alt-3_ table had Napoli in 4th place, ahead of Juventus; and Benevento were placed 13th in the _alt-3_ table.

Now that the season is complete, we see that Napoli finished 5th, below Juventus; and Benevento are relegated from _Serie A_ having finished 18th.

This is nice empirical evidence --- if any such evidence is needed --- of my frequently-repeated assertion that **the alt-3 table is not a prediction**.  The purpose of the _alt-3_ table is (only) to provide a better indication --- i.e., better than the official league table --- of team standings at the time when the _alt-3_ table is computed. 

Napoli managed only a draw in their last match, at home to Verona; whereas Juventus achieved wins in all of their last three matches --- including a stunning home win against table-topping rivals Internazionale, from an 89th-minute penalty --- to clinch qualification for next season's UEFA Champions League.

Benevento's fate was sealed by poor results in their last four matches, three of which were against similarly low-ranked opponents; in particular, the home defeat against Cagliari was decisive.

So, it's congratulations to Juventus and commiserations to Benevento. 

Football is a gloriously unpredictable game, and long may it remain so!
