While most of the current interest in the 
[**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league)
relates to the [relegation battle](/2018/03/06/epl-relegation-battle),
there's also a nice side-note to make about the battle for the important 4th place
in the Premier League.

While Spurs might look to have it pretty much in the bag --- because in the official league
table they are currently 5 points ahead of Chelsea --- it's actually closer than that,
once the two clubs' remaining fixtures are taken into account.

Spurs will play 5 of their remaining 9 matches away from home, while Chelsea will have to 
travel just 4 times more this season. 

When those facts are taken into account via the _alt-3_ algorithm, 
along with the positions of Chelsea's and Spurs' 
opponents in the remaining 9 matches, the upshot is a bonus of 1.0 league points 
for Chelsea but a small penalty of &minus;0.3 points for Spurs.  In the 
more informative
[**_alt-3_ table**](/leagues/england-premier-league), then **Spurs are currently 
only 3.7 points
ahead of Chelsea**.
