There were no surprises in this weekend's round of Premier League matches.
But I just realised that my last two blog posts featured Bournemouth --- 
so let's go for the hat-trick here!

AFC Bournemouth's (unsurprising, and very convincing) 
home win over Huddersfield Town on Saturday lifts 
them up to 
**9th place** in this week's [*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league),
just ahead of Leicester City (who, like Bournemouth, have had a relatively tough 
schedule of fixtures so far this season). 

As I
[explained in last week's blog post](/2017/11/10/grueltide), Bournemouth
almost certainly face the hardest first-half-season schedule of any club in 
the Premier League this year. In the 'official' league table, 
that will leave the Cherries around 2 points short of what would be a fair reflection
of their *real* standing in the league at Christmas --- 
the 'fair reflection' being the *alt-3* table, of course! 

So Bournemouth really are *flying*! And *whatever* league position they can get to by Christmas, the Cherries can look forward to what should be an easier fixture-list in the second half of the season.
