Here it is: the first public appearance this season of the
     [*alt-3* table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

The main stories so far to come from the *alt-3* calculation are:
- **West Ham** have played only higher-placed opponents
  in their first 8 matches.  The Hammers' 7 accumulated league points
  understates by quite a margin (nearly 5 points, in effect)
  how well they have done so far.  In
  the *alt-3* table (which --- in a
  mathematically coherent way --- takes proper account
  of schedule strength to date) they are currently
  placed 12th, compared with 15th in the official
  Premier League table. 
- **Liverpool** top the current *alt-3* table, just ahead of Manchester City.
  The two clubs are level on league points (19 each at present); and City's
  better goal difference puts them just ahead in the official Premier League
  table.  But Liverpool have had an appreciably harder start to the season,
  including away matches at Spurs and Chelsea; and that is enough to put
  Liverpool ahead of City at the top of the *alt-3* table.
  Adding a bit of extra context to tomorrow's
  head-to-head match Liverpool v Man City at Anfield...
