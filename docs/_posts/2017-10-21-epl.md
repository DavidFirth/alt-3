Huddersfield Town jump to 12th place in the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league) 
after their victory over Manchester United.  Now it's Newcastle, and 
especially Southampton, whose 'points in the bag' total flatters them
by an appreciable margin.

(Southampton's only really 'hard' match so far this season had been 
against Man Utd,
so the [Saints' schedule strength](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Sot/) rating took quite a hit today. Their victory
over West Brom sees them still clear of the relegation zone, though.)

Everton and Liverpool are both doing better, still, 
than their accumulated
league points would suggest, because they both have faced relatively tough
schedules to date.
