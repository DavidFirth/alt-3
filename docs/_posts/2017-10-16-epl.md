In yesterday's blog post I forgot to mention that **Liverpool**
are like Stoke and Everton, in that the current 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league) gives them
quite a boost. 

A look at Liverpool's 
[schedule-strength chart](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Liv/) 
shows that they have had a relatively tough start to the season. That tough start 
continues next week with a trip to Spurs.  But after that, their run of fixtures to
the end of 2017 looks a whole lot easier &mdash; which 
results in a 2-point adjustment
on Liverpool's 
standing in the league table (enough to lift them at present above Chelsea,
Burnley and Arsenal).
