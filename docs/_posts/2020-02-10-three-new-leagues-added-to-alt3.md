Three new league tables have been added to the *alt-3* website this week:

- **Germany:** [**Bundesliga 1**](/leagues/germany-bundesliga-1)
- **Italy:** [**Serie A**](/leagues/italy-serie-a)
- **Spain:** [**La Liga Primera**](/leagues/spain-la-liga-primera)

I will do my best to keep them all up to date (at least weekly, 
if not more often than that).

To see any football club's current
schedule-strength chart, just click on the club name in
the relevant *alt-3* league table.

I will mention here just a couple of highlights from the current tables. 
(There is not much to say about La Liga at present, 
so the focus here will be
on Italy and Germany.)

## Serie A: Juventus are slightly ahead

In the official Serie A 
league table, Internazionale are ahead of Juventus on 
goal difference. But *alt-3* takes proper account of the fixture schedule,
and shows Juve slightly ahead at the top. The reason is (essentially) that 
**Juve played both Inter and Lazio away from home 
in the first half of the season**; whereas Inter played both Juve and 
Lazio at home. So Juventus have faced the tougher fixture schedule so far: 
and by the *alt-3* calculation they are doing slightly better than 
Internazionale this season, up to now.

## Bundesliga: Harder times ahead for Wolfsburg

VfL 
Wolfsburg have seen an uncommonly easy start to the second half of the 
season, with all four of their recent 
matches being against opponents from the bottom 6. Their 10th position in 
the official Bundesliga table flatters Wolfsburg: the *alt-3* table,
which takes full account of the fixtures already played, has Wolfsburg 
currently in 12th place.
