This weekend Manchester United lost at Huddersfield, while 
Tottenham Hotspur beat Liverpool.

That puts Man Utd and Spurs level on points now, with Man Utd slightly ahead in the
conventional kind of league table because of their better goal difference.

Both clubs have had relatively easy starts to the season. Just take a look at 
the two clubs' *schedule strength* graphs:
- [Man Utd](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-MnU/) schedule strength, currently [**&minus;2.4**](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-MnU/)
- [Spurs](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Tot/), currently [**&minus;1.4**](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Tot/)

Man Utd's fixture schedule to date has been even easier than that of Spurs. 

In the 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league), then, Spurs are 
clearly ahead, purely on the basis of what they 
have achieved so far this season.  If all teams were to 
continue to perform as well (or as badly) 
as they have done
already this season, Spurs would finish the season ahead of Man Utd. 

(But they both would be well behind Manchester City!)

This might all become clearer, 
of course, when Spurs travel to Old Trafford next week. 
I don't make predictions, though.
