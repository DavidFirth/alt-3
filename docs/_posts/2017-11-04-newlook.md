In response to various suggestions that people have made, I have 
today overhauled the appearance of the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

I hope it's better (I think it is, myself --- but I am biased!)

If any other 
visitor here has suggestions for further improvements to the way
that the table is presented, please either tweet to @footymath or
use the 'Contact' link at the top of the page.
