Bournemouth's stunning win at St James's Park yesterday lifts them above
Southampton, West Brom and Newcastle to 14th place in the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

Bournemouth have had a harder run of fixtures since the start of the season
than both Newcastle and Southampton. This is clear from the clubs' respective
*alt-3* schedule strength charts:
 
* [AFC Bournemouth](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Bou/);
* [Newcastle United](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-New/); 
* [Southampton](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Sot/).

Newcastle and Southampton are both flattered by their current points totals.  They each 
face a relatively tough set of fixtures in the coming weeks.
