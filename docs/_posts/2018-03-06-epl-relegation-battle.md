It's that time of year again, when the remaining 
fixtures of bottom-half clubs come under close scrutiny. The unique
_alt-3_ methodology comes into its own at this point --- it can put
some principled, 
mathematical muscle on the bones of those fixture lists.

Unless some miracle happens, one of the relegation spots looks to be spoken for already. 
West Brom have been remarkably consistent since the first two weeks of 
this season, at least as far as match results go!

If West Brom don't achieve their hoped-for 'Great Escape II', 
that still leaves two relegation places wide open.  Every club below the current 
top 8 is still to some degree in danger --- which is pretty unusual at this late 
stage of the season.

The [**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) re-orders the official
Premier League table, in a mathematically principled way to take account of how easy
or hard each team's season has been up to now (and therefore, at the same time, 
how hard or easy is each team's remaining fixture list). The _alt-3_ table 
takes into account,
for each team, which other teams have been played already, and whether matches were
played at home or away. 

A crucial point about _alt-3_ is that it is not a prediction of the future, just a 
better representation of this season's match results to date 
--- and, importantly, a representation
that fully respects the league's points system (3 for a win, 1 for a draw).
In essence, the method gives a systematically better answer to
the question: 'If all clubs were to continue to achieve match results consistent with 
their actual results so far this season, how should we expect 
the league table to look at the end of the season?' 

That's a 'what if?' question --- and the answer is
just a projection forward from the season's results so far.  The 
point of the _alt-3_ methodology is to provide a systematically _more informative_ 
projection
forward than the officlal league table does --- no more, no less than that.

# Saints and Seagulls set to struggle?

Right now, the [**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) shows that two
clubs --- Brighton and Southampton --- face particularly tough fixture lists in their 
remaining 9 matches.

## Southampton in the relegation zone

The current [**_alt-3_ Premier League table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) has 
**Southampton
in the relegation zone**, in 18th place (as opposed to 17th place in the official Premier
League table).  The reason becomes clear when we look at Southampton's remaining 
9 fixtures: the **Saints will play 6 of those 9 matches away from home, and they will play
4 of the current top 8 clubs** in their remaining matches.

The _alt-3_ methodology quantifies just how hard that remaining fixture list is, 
in terms of the effective number of league points that should be subtracted from
Southampton's current total to take account of the fact that they have faced a relatively
easy fixture list so far. The Saints' current _alt-3_ schedule strength rating, as shown
in the above schedule-strength chart, is 
**&minus;1.5 league points**, which is strongly negative and 
more than enough to move them below Crystal Palace.

As **an aside**: 
A remarkable feature of Southampton's schedule-strength chart is that it shows that their 
position in the official league table has probably 
flattered the Saints, _through the whole of this
season_. This is just an accident of the fixture-list scheduling.  At no point
this season have Southampton been in the position of having an easier fixture 
list ahead of them than the matches they had already played!

## Brighton not really a top-half club, just yet

</center>

The club whose run-in to the end of the season is rated as the _hardest of all_ is 
**Brighton and Hove Albion**. In their remaining 9 matches the **Seagulls will play 5 games
away from home, and will face no fewer than 6 of the current top 8 teams in the league**.

That sounds like an extremely tough run of matches for Brighton!  The 
[**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league)
quantifies just how hard: in order to take that properly 
into account in the league standings,
**2.2 league points** should be deducted from Brighton's current total. Right now, then, 
based on all their results to date, **Brighton are more justifiably placed 12th** 
in the league
--- not 10th as in the official league table at present, 
which takes no account of the Seagulls' 
relatively easy list of matches played to date.

# Exciting finish in prospect!

The [**_alt-3_ Premier League table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) is updated 
every week, to incorporate the results from each matchday.

To see any club's current *alt-3* 
schedule-strength chart, just click on the club name in
the [*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

As the end of the season gets very near, the schedule-strength imbalances
will all steadily vanish, of course: in the end, every team will have played all 
others twice, once at home and once away.  The _alt-3_ method will therefore 
agree perfectly with the official league table by the end of the season.
Until then, though, the *alt-3* table continues to provide a more informative
view of where each team stands.
