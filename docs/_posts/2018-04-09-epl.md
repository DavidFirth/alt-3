Every Premier League team now 
has either 5 or 6 matches remaining this season.
The [**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) takes
proper account of games in hand --- as well as the strength of opponents 
in each club's remaining fixtures --- to give a more 
informative picture of
how the league currently stands.

At the top of the table, there's not much to say other than that 
Tottenham have a game in hand over Liverpool, which puts Spurs in third
place once that is taken into account.

Much less obvious is the situation nearer the *bottom* of the table.
As has been the case for much of this season, it is very congested
in the lower half of the Premier League.  The *alt-3* table does have
a more interesting story to tell there --- most notably about the relative
standing of Brighton and Crystal Palace, who will face each other at 
Selhurst Park next
weekend in the so-called 'M23 derby' match.

## Brighton's tough run-in (and Palace's relatively easy stroll)

Despite the fact that Brighton have four more points in the bag than
Crystal Palace, *and* a game in hand, today's 
[**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) shows the 
two local rivals neck-and-neck, with Palace even a bit *ahead* of Brighton
once proper account is taken of the matches already played (and thus 
also the matches that are still to be played) by each team.

The reason is that the two clubs are currently **at opposite ends of
the 'schedule strength' spectrum**. Brighton's current *alt-3* 
schedule-strength rating is &minus;3.1 points, reflecting that they
have the hardest run-in of any team to the end of the season; 
whereas Crystal Palace's rating is +2.1, implying that they have
the *easiest* run-in of any team.
The difference (5.2) between those two schedule strengths is just 
enough to 
reverse the two clubs' positions in the *alt-3* league table, even
though Brighton have a match in hand.

This excerpt from Brighton's current
schedule-strength chart shows just how hard
their season end looks to be:

</center>
Brighton will play **4 of their remaining 6 matches away from home**, and
they must still **face 5 of the current top 7** 
clubs in the Premier League. 
Alternatively, viewed from another angle: Brighton's
current total of 35 Premier League points has been achieved with
the help of
the relatively
easy set of fixtures that Brighton have had since the halfway point 
of the season.

**Neither Crystal Palace nor Brighton are yet clear of 
relegation danger.  And the *alt-3* analysis shows just how close
the two clubs are to one another, ahead of the coming weekend's 
head-to-head 'M23 derby' match.**

A couple of further things worth mentioning in connection with this:
- the *alt-3* ranking should not be viewed as a *prediction* of teams'
final league standings. It simply provides a coherent picture of 
*current* standings --- a picture that takes proper account of relative
fixture-list strengths and games in hand.
- the *alt-3* ranking takes no account of *goal difference*, and of course
that can be important at the end of the season in the event that teams
are level on points.  (Brighton currently do have a slightly
better goal difference than Crystal Palace.)

The point about 'not a prediction' is important.  The *alt-3* method
(just as the official league table) is based on all of this season's 
match results --- but nothing else. For accurate *prediction*, 
on the other hand, such things as
player injuries, suspensions, managerial changes, cup tournaments and 
'current form' might also be thought relevant; but all such things
are ignored by *alt-3*. 

(In relation to Brighton's remaining fixtures, for example,
it is noteworthy that their game in hand arises from postponement of
a match against Manchester City. By the time City get to play Brighton
it seems likely they will have won the league already --- something that
could conceivably work to Brighton's advantage. That is potentially 
useful information for predictive purposes, but it plays no role
in either the official Premier League table or the *alt-3* view of it.)
