Today's [*alt-3* Premier League table](/leagues/england-premier-league) is the first
one to be presented in a re-designed format.

The table itself (i.e., the ordering of teams) is unchanged, as is
    the underlying method.

The re-design affects only the way in which the table is presented --- specifically
    the rightmost two columns, which are the essence
    of the _alt-3_ table.  The 'old' format showed an additive schedule-strength
    adjustment to every team's current league points total.  That is now replaced by
    a presentation that copes better with (especially) 'games in hand', i.e.,
    those frequent
    times in the season when not all teams have played the same number of matches.

The new presentation also eliminates any hint of _prediction_ in relation to
    the _alt-3_ method --- which is important, as the _alt-3_ league table is
    definitely not a prediction, merely a faithful representation of where
    teams currently stand. 

The new _alt-3_ table format uses the same (mathematically principled and
    internally consistent) schedule-strength calculation as always, but now
    represents it in a more streamlined way
    through each team's _effective number of matches played_ --- the new **ePld**
    column in the table.

A snapshot of today's _alt-3_ Premier League table illustrates how this works:
<center>
	<img src="/assets/images/2018-11-06-epl-table.png">
</center>	      
Every team has played 11 league matches.  But the **effective** number of matches
      played varies.
      A team that has played an exceptionally tough set of fixtures so
      far this season has seen less real
      opportunity to accumulate league points, and so has a value of **ePld**
      that is smaller than 11.  Likewise, a team whose fixtures have been easier than
      average has a larger **ePld** (larger than the 11 matches actually played).

> In the current Premier League table, the most extreme example is
  **West Ham United**
   (as I [wrote about previously](/2018/10/06/epl)).  The Hammers faced
   an exceptionally tough run of fixtures in their first 10 matches of this season:
   see their current
   [schedule-strength chart](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-WHU)
   for the detail.  Their current schedule-strength rating is +3.0; and this
   makes their current **ePld** equal to 11 &minus; 3.0 = 8.0.
   The way to think about this in terms of
   _effective number of matches played_ is that **West Ham have effectively
   three games in hand at this point in time**.

-----
	
Once the current values of **ePld** have been calculated, the _alt-3_ table is
formed simply by ranking the teams according to their
**league points per effective match played**, i.e.,
<center><b>Rate = Pts &#247; ePld</b>.</center>

-----

>  Unfortunately for West Ham
	      this does not quite do enough to lift them from 13th position
	       in the table, since their nearest neighbours (in terms of league
	       points total) are Brighton and Hove Albion,
	       who also have faced a tougher than
	       average start to the season (Brighton's
	       current schedule strength is +1.2).

-----
	       
It is perhaps worth reiterating, that the _alt-3_
   ranking methodology (and hence the ranking of the _alt-3_ table
   itself) is completely unchanged from before.  All that has changed, with today's
   re-design, is the way of presenting things.

I (of course) think it's a definite improvement.  I hope others will agree!
