With only Leicester vs West Brom still to play in this
season's 8th round of Premier League matches,
the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league)
now lifts Stoke City along with Everton, since they both have faced relatively
strong opposition in their first 8 matches.  On the other hand 
**Huddersfield Town**, who are listed in 12th place in the usual league table
(i.e., the ranking determined by accumulated points to date), are placed **17th**
in the *alt-3* table.  If Leicester can beat West Brom 
on Monday evening, Huddersfield will take their place in the relegation
zone according to the *alt-3* table.

The reason? Huddersfield's fixture list to date has been Palace (away),
Newcastle (home), Southampton (home), West Ham (away), Leicester (home), Burnley (away),
Spurs (home) and Swansea (away). A quick look at their 
[schedule-strength chart](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Hud/) 
shows that Huddersfield face a much tougher run of matches in the coming weeks!
