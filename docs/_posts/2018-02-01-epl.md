This is still a fairly quiet part of the season for the
[**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league),
but some schedule-strength differences are starting to emerge again after
December's halfway point.

A quick glance at today's table might suggest that most of the action 
is near the _bottom_ of the current Premier League table.  But actually
the schedule-strength differences are still fairly small at present,
among the bottom 10 clubs. Southampton drop to 19th place in the
[**_alt-3_ table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) though --- clearly 
below
Swansea, who climb just clear of the relegation zone.  Southampton
have faced a relatively easy fixture list up to now, compared with
Swansea's.  (Southampton's 
current schedule strength is &minus;1.4 points,
compared with +0.4 points for Swansea.)

## Liverpool above Chelsea

After this week's win for Liverpool at Huddersfield and Chelsea's home
defeat to Bournemouth, the official Premier League table
puts Liverpool and Chelsea level on 50 points each.  But once
schedule strength is taken into account, a two-point gap opens 
up: Liverpool are now clearly in third place, ahead of Chelsea (and
indeed now just two points behind Manchester United, in the 
[**_alt-3_ table**](/leagues/england-premier-league)).

Liverpool's and Chelsea's current 
schedule-strength charts show this graphically.
For example, whereas Liverpool's next 4 fixtures look relatively easy
(they will play 
Spurs, West Ham and Newcastle at home, and Southampton away),
Chelsea's next 4 matches include away trips to both Manchester United
and Manchester City.
