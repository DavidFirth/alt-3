This weekend's fixtures saw the completion of the 13th round of 
Premier League matches.

A notable feature of the 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league) right now is that
Chelsea and Arsenal are in 2nd and 3rd places, 
ahead of Manchester United --- despite the 
fact that United have got more 'points in the bag'. 

The reason is simple: United have enjoyed a remarkably soft start to this 
season, so far, whereas both Chelsea and Arsenal have faced much tougher 
schedules.

Of the 13 matches played by United to date, seven were played at 
Old Trafford; and only *three* were against teams that are in the current
top 8 of the Premier League.

Chelsea and Arsenal, on the other hand, have each played 7 of their 
13 matches *away* from home. And they have both played all or 
nearly all of the other top-8 clubs. (Chelsea have played all 7 of them, 
and Arsenal have played 6 out of 7.)

This all translates into positive *alt-3* schedule-strength
points for Chelsea and Arsenal (they both are on schedule strength +2.1 
at present). For Man Utd it's the opposite: schedule strength &minus;2.3.
That's more than enough of a difference to bridge 
the gap between United and the two London clubs, leaving [United 
narrowly behind both Chelsea and Arsenal in the current 
*alt-3* table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

Man Utd face a substantially tougher fixture list than either Chelsea's or
Arsenal's, in the 
coming weeks up to the halfway point of this season --- so
**United still have a lot to prove!**.
