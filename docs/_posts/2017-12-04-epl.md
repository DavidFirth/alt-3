Manchester United's win at Arsenal, following hot on the heels of their 
equally impressive win at Watford, establishes United firmly in second place,
now clearly above Chelsea in the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).  Prior to this week,
United's relatively easy fixture list had enabled Chelsea to claim the
2nd spot, in our league table that coherently accounts for the strength
of opposition that clubs have faced so far. But those two away wins
for Man Utd in the last few days, 
both against highly placed opponents, have firmly 
re-established
United's credentials now as the main challengers to Manchester City.

## Saints and Potters

The other main story in this week's *alt-3* table is about **Southampton and 
Stoke City**. 
Southampton have had the easiest fixture list of any Premier League club
so far this season, and for that reason their current 
points total gives a false impression
of the Saints' league standing. The 
[*alt-3* table](/leagues/england-premier-league) has **Southampton down in
15th place at present** 
--- whereas in the standard table based on 'points in the bag'
they appear in 11th place, narrowly ahead of Brighton on goal difference.

That 11th spot, in the *alt-3* table, is now occupied instead by Stoke City who,
despite having bagged one point less than Southampton and Brighton, have
had a less easy ride in the fixtures faced so far this season.

So Stoke are not doing too badly, all things considered. 

**Southampton have a pretty hard run of fixtures to
come**, though, up to the end of 2017 --- including a home game with Arsenal, 
and matches away at Chelsea, Tottenham and Man Utd.
