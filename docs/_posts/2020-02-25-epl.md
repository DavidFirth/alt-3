Here is a snapshot of how the battle to avoid relegation looks currently, 
in the [**_alt-3_ Premier League table**](/leagues/england-premier-league):

While West Ham are in 18th place in the official Premier League table, the _alt-3_ calculation puts the Hammers in 16th place instead, above both Aston Villa and Bournemouth.

To see why that is, we can look at the current _alt-3_ schedule-strength charts:

While Bournemouth face an exceptionally 
tough run-in to the end of the season --- 
which includes
matches against all of the top 3 teams in the league --- West Ham have already 
played all of their matches against the top 3, and they have a (relatively) easier 
run-in, on paper at any rate. The difference is quantified by the _alt-3_ method:
**West Ham currently have, in effect, 3.3 matches in hand over Bournemouth** (that's
the difference between 28.9 and 25.6, from the table as shown above).

And the Hammers also have effectively 2.4 games in hand over Aston Villa.

That's enough to lift West Ham above both Bournemouth and Aston Villa,
in the current _alt-3_ table (which coherently takes account of this kind of 
schedule-strength imbalance).

This is emphatically **not a prediction** 
of anything: in order to escape relegation, West Ham
would still need to actually 
_win_ some of those remaining "relatively easy" matches!  But the _alt-3_ table
does give a more realistic picture than does the official league table at this 
point in the season, as far as current standings are concerned.
