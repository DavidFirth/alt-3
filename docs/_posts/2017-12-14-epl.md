Of the four clubs vying currently for 4th place in the Premier league,
Arsenal have had the toughest fixture list to date, and Tottenham
Hotspur have had the easiest. 

By the principled *alt-3* calculation,
the difference in schedule strengths between the two clubs is
equivalent to 2.7 league points --- enough to put [**Arsenal clearly
ahead of Spurs in the current 
_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league), despite 
the fact that Spurs have one more point 'in the bag' than Arsenal
after 17 matches played.  The *alt-3* table currently has Arsenal
in 4th place and Spurs in 7th --- an exact reversal of their current 
standings in the official league table.

A quick look at the two clubs' current **schedule strength charts**
explains that reversal:

- [**Tottenham Hotspur**](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Tot) 

Arsenal have played 9 of their 17 matches away from home, and will
complete this first half of the season with two home matches.  Spurs,
on the other hand, have already played 9 matches at home, and their
remaining first-half-season fixtures are away at Manchester City
and Burnley.
