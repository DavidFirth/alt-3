Manchester United's win yesterday 
at Watford --- a relatively tough away trip for any club this season 
--- brings them closer to Chelsea in the current
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league); and it also now 
lifts United clearly above 
Arsenal.  Both Chelsea and Arsenal won at home against
relatively easy opponents in tonight's Premier League matches, so 
in the *alt-3* reckoning they both lose a bit of ground to 
United (since United had beaten higher-placed opposition, and 
away from home too).

[Chelsea's current *alt-3* schedule-strength rating of +1.5](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Che) is what
is keeping them just above United, still.
But even that makes almost no dent on
the enormous lead that Manchester City now have --- by any reckoning! --- 
at the top of the table.
