We're 5 matches in, and the first [**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) of the season is now online.  With Liverpool so far ahead already, all the action in this first *alt-3* table of the new season is further down the league.

It's early days, and we can expect things to change a lot over the next few weeks. 
But the headlines right now are:

- **Southampton**, **Norwich** and **Burnley** have all faced a fairly tough start to the season.
- The _alt-3_ method of presenting the league table has **Southampton currently in 3rd** place (not 10th as shown in the official league standings).
- At the other end of the scale, **Everton** and **Watford** have both had --- by the _alt-3_ reckoning --- a notably easy start to the season.
- The _alt-3_ table has **Everton in 15th place** (not 11th as shown in the official league standings).

The difference between Southampton and Everton is therefore _much_ bigger than the official league table would suggest!

## Southampton

The Saints have played 3 of their first 5 matches away from home, but what has 
really 
limited their potential to gain points so far is the fact that they have already 
played Liverpool.  In effect then --- since Liverpool so far are beating everyone
they play --- Southampton have effectively had only 4 opportunities to 
gain points in the league; and yet still they have 7 points. That's a better points
rate, by the (correct!) _alt-3_ reckoning, than any of the 6 clubs currently
sitting on 8 points.

So **Southampton currently can reasonably claim to be in 3rd place!**

Their current _alt-3_ schedule-strength graph (below) 
nicely illustrates this: the Saints
have played 4 "average" matches (in terms of strength of opponents, and 
home advantage), and the match against Liverpool. Hence the "effective matches played" (**ePld**) for Southampton in the _alt-3_ table is 4.0 (to 1 decimal place), 
which results in the points-per-effective-match-played **rate** of 1.73.

## Everton

At the other extreme in terms of schedule strength, Everton have already 
had what would appear to be two of their clearest opportunities to collect
league points (i.e., home matches against Wolves and Watford).  Everton's
current _alt-3_ schedule-strength rating means that their "effective matches
played" (**ePld**) is 2 more than the 5 matches 
they have _actually_ played.  As a result,
Everton are currently **down 4 places** 
in the _alt-3_ table (relative to their standing
in the official table, which takes no account of schedule strength).

## What about other Premier League clubs?

To see any Premier League 
team's schedule-strength graph, just click on the team name in the 
current [*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

(Just don't bother to look at Liverpool's graph! For Liverpool, on the form
they have shown so far this season, all opponents are just "average", so the
graph carries no information at all.)

## NB: Not a prediction!

See the <a href="/about">about alt-3</a> 
pages, for full details of the _alt-3_ method.

A crucial message there is that the _alt-3_ table is **not in any way a prediction**: rather, it is
simply **a better representation of current league standings**, based on all the 
match results so far this season.
