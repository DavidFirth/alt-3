Really excited to be speaking at this year's 
[New England Symposium on Statistics in Sports](http://nessis.org/) 
this weekend.

It's a chance to get some good feedback on the *alt-3* method,
and on how we present the resulting league tables here on the website.

I look forward to meeting a lot of new people at the conference!
