The *alt-3* [EFL Championship table](/leagues/england-championship) 
appears here for the first time this week.

Over the next few weeks I plan to add other major leagues from across Europe.

To see any club's 
schedule-strength chart, just click on the club name in
the [EFL Championship table](/leagues/england-championship).
