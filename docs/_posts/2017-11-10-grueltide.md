Christmas comes but once a year...and so does the half-way point of 
a football league season.

This year, if all Premier League fixtures go ahead as planned,
then by December 24th every team will have played 19 matches --- that's exactly half of the season completed.   At Christmas most teams will have played every other 
team in the league once. (There are some exceptions --- more on that below.)

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/alt-tree.svg" style="width: 30%;" title="The 'alt-tree' (image), derived from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Christmas_tree.svg --- please 
respect the original license as described there">
It should be admitted that
**Christmas is a relatively dull time** for the 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league). 
The sort of 
fixture-list imbalance that the *alt-3* method eliminates is
almost *absent* at the half-way point of the season --- precisely
because most teams have played everyone else in the league once, at that point.

(It won't be the case that teams have played equal numbers of matches at home and away, 
of course --- because 19 is an odd number.)

**But still**, even at the halfway point of the season, some clubs will have faced
a markedly harder or easier set of 19 matches than is typical of their whole season.
I highlight here the four clubs whose *alt-3 schedule strength* for fixtures before 
Christmas differs appreciably from zero (i.e., whose schedule strength is rated at +1.5 
league points or higher, or &minus;1.5 league points or lower). 

## Bournemouth's gruelling run up to Christmas

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/2017-11-11-Bou.svg" style="width:33%; 
margin-left:10px;" title="Schedule strength chart, AFC Bournemouth, as at 2017-11-10">
In their 19 matches up to the season's halfway point, Bournemouth will not only
have played **10 matches away from home**, they will also be the only team
to have faced current
league leaders **Manchester City twice**.

This is captured perfectly by today's 
**_alt-3_ schedule-strength chart for Bournemouth** (snapshot on the right),
which shows a value of +1.9 after 23 December when
the Cherries play Man City for the second time 
--- representing 
by far the hardest first-half-season fixture list
of any Premier League team. 

What that means is that Bournemouth's
Premier League points total at Christmas --- *whatever* that total turns out to 
be at the time 
--- will not
really be the best indication of their season up to that point. To take account of
the fact that Bournemouth's first-half-season 
fixtures have been quite a bit harder than typical,
we should add 1.9 points to their Christmas tally 
--- which is precisely the kind of adjustment that the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league) makes consistently,
every week, for every team in the league.
(Note that the exact figure '1.9' just mentioned for Bournemouth 
might change slightly over time, to take account of match results between now and 
Christmas.  But it's very unlikely to change by *much*, if at all.)

The 'official' Premier League table at Christmas will be a rather mean one, then, for 
Bournemouth supporters. But of course the flip-side of all this is that
the Cherries will face the **_easiest_ second-half-season fixture list** of any club
in the league!



## Newcastle, Southampton, Swansea: Make the most of your Christmas presents!

The opposite situation to Bournemouth's applies to three other clubs (all of which
--- coincidentally? --- are struggling to find form at the time of writing this).

The *easiest* fixture lists in the first half of the season belong to Newcastle,
Southampton and Swansea (whose schedule-strength ratings for the halfway point of
the season currently stand at &minus;1.5, &minus;1.8 and &minus;1.7, respectively).

Here is a snapshot of those three clubs' schedule-strength charts, as they stand today:

<img width="100%" src="/assets/images/2017-11-11-New-Sou-Swa.svg" title="Schedule strength charts, Newcastle, Southampton and Swansea, as at 2017-11-10">

After completion of the last round of Premier League matches before Christmas:

+ **Southampton** will have played **11 of their first 19 matches at home**.

+ **Swansea** will have played 10 of their first 19 at home; and 
after the match on 23 December they will already have 
played struggling **Crystal Palace twice**.

+ **Newcastle**, although playing away from home in 10 of the first 19 matches,
**will not face league-leaders Manchester City** in the first half of the season: they
will instead be tested twice by City in the weeks that come *after* Christmas.

So **Newcastle, Southampton and Swansea will all have Premier League points totals at 
Christmas that flatter them quite a bit** --- regardless of their position in the league at
that time.  Their supporters probably should try to enjoy it while it lasts?
