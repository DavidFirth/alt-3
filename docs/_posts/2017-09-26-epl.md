The weekend's results see Everton climb still further in the
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league), 
which takes full account of the strength of opponents that each 
team has faced so far.

In their first six matches, Everton have already faced Man City, Man Utd,
Chelsea and Spurs.  Because of this, the alternative league table puts
Everton in 9th place, ahead of Newcastle, West Brom, Huddersfield and
Southampton (all of which have a higher points total, but none of which
has had nearly such a tough fixture list as Everton).

West Ham and Bournemouth are two other clubs that have had relatively
hard fixture lists so far --- but not hard enough to lift either
of them out of the relegation places.

The next update to the *alt-3* table will appear by Tuesday 3 October, 
when all clubs will have played seven matches.
