When I looked last night at the 
[Championship table](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/england-championship)
I realised that --- in my rush to get _alt-3_ back online in the last few days --- I had forgotten to include this season's 6-point deduction for Sheffield Wednesday.  So the _alt-3_ table for the Championship has been a bit wrong at the bottom end, in the last few days (apologies!)

It is now fixed.  And, better still, I have coded in a check for this sort of thing so that it won't happen again, the next time a team has league points deducted.
