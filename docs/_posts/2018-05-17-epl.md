With the 2017--18
Premier League season now all finished, the _alt-3_ table shows perfect
agreement with the official league table --- exactly as it
should do, by design!  (The _alt-3_ method adjusts _only_ for
schedule-strength differences; and at the end of the season
such differences are completely absent.)

The schedule strength chart for each club can still
    tell an interesting story, though.  Below I will just pick out three
    such stories.  Quick summaries are:
- **Brighton** defied expectations to overcome an exceptionally
  hard run-in to the end of the season;
- **Everton** sacked two managers, and even after taking account of the
  team's tough
  fixtures under Ronald Koeman it's clear that Sam Allardyce did better;
- **Southampton**'s match
  results were actually better in the second half-season (despite the
  fact that the Saints were 13th in the official league table at
  Christmas, but finished the season in 17th place).

## Brighton

   In [this earlier post on April 9th](/2018/04/09/epl/),
   with 6 matches still to play
   it was notable that Brighton faced a formidable set of fixtures up to the
   end of the season.  Here is how their schedule-strength chart looked,
   at that point:

</center>        
I commented on April 9th that the away match at Crystal Palace
   looked like a "must win" match for Brighton, given their tough remaining
   fixtures after that.

In the event though,
   Brighton _lost_ against Crystal Palace.  But although they
   had flunked what had
   looked to be the _easiest_ of their last 6 matches of the
   season, Brighton went on to gain even more than
   the necessary points for Premier League survival,
   through a remarkable trio of results --- draws with Spurs
   and Burnley, and a win over Manchester United.

All of which amply demonstrates just how gloriously
unpredictable football can be!

## Everton

Much of my early-season commentary on the _alt-3_ table was about Everton,
     whose fixture list had pitched them against a string of top
     opponents in those first few weeks.

In [this post on October 22nd](2017/10/22/epl),
   after all clubs had played 9 matches, it was notable that although
   Everton were placed 18th in the official league table, their true
   standing at that point
   was 12th (i.e., in the _alt-3_ table which takes proper account
   of schedule strength).  The next day, Everton sacked their manager Ronald
   Koeman.  (Koeman is now coach of the Netherlands national team.)
   
When Sam Allardyce took over as the club's new manager,
     five weeks later, he inherited
     a rather
     easier set of fixtures up to the halfway point of Everton's
     season.
     Through the lens of _alt-3_, we can now measure accurately
     the relative success of
     Everton managers
     Koeman and Allardyce in the 2017--18 season.

Everton's _alt-3_
	  schedule-strength total for the first 9 matches of the season
	  is +1.65 league points --- i.e.,
	  1.65 points should be added to
	  Everton's official points total on October 22nd, to adjust
	  correctly for their relatively tough fixture list in the first 9
	  matches.  (Actually,
	  as things stood on October 22nd after the home match
	  against Arsenal, Everton's reported schedule
	  strength rating was *+1.9*, which is slightly different from the
	  *+1.65*
	  figure just quoted.  The difference comes from the fact
	  that we now have the
	  full season's Premier League
	  results rather than just the first 9 matches.)  The *+1.65* figure
	  comes from the relevant point --- i.e., the home match
	  with Arsenal at matchweek 9 --- in 
	  Everton's _final_ schedule-strength chart, as computed at
	  the end of the season:

</center>

What this means is that Everton under Ronald
     Koeman had effectively earned 1.65 points more,
     after 9 matches played, than their official tally of
     8 league points.  So Koeman's effective
     points-per-match rate was $$(8 + 1.65)/9 = 1.07$$.
     
On the flip side, Sam Allardyce's accumulated points total of 34 from 
   his 24 matches in charge needs to be *reduced* by 0.75 points,
   to take account
   of Everton's 
   easier fixture list from that point on.  (Allardyce took over as manager
   after the home match against West Ham, and
   the figure of *0.75* again comes
   from the relevant point in above schedule-strength chart.)  So Big Sam's
   effective points per match rate was $$(34 - 0.75)/24 = 1.39$$.

So Sam Allardyce did produce appreciably
   better results for Everton than Ronald Koeman's, even
   after allowing for 
   the fact that Allardyce's team played easier fixtures
   than they had played under Koeman.
 
(But that did not prevent Everton from sacking Allardyce, too,
      at the end of the season!)

## Southampton

Southampton started the season with relatively "easy" fixtures
(matches at home against Swansea and West Ham) --- and then remarkably,
for the entire season, **never had an easier schedule ahead of them
than the matches they had already played**.  That is to say, in their
schedule-strength graph the Saints stayed to the left of the centre-line,
		  right up until the last day of the season.

Southampton had the easiest first half-season of any club, by some distance.  They made 19 points from those first 19 matches (11 of which were played at home) --- but really that was worth only around 17 points once fixture difficulty is taken into account.  See 
	    [the "Grueltide" post](/2017/11/10/grueltide) for more details if interested.

So the Saints' season-end tally of 36 points came from, in effect, 19 points in the second half of the season --- so a **better second half-season than first half, even though they were 13th in the official league table at Christmas and 17th by the end**.  (In the _alt-3_ table, which takes schedule strength properly into account, Southampton were placed 15th at Christmas).
