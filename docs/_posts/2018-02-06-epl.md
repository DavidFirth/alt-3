After last night's defeat to Watford, Chelsea are now just one point
ahead of Tottenham Hotspur in the [official Premier League table](https://www.premierleague.com/tables). When schedule strength is properly taken into account,
though, that slender one-point advantage is not enough: the more
accurate [**_alt-3_ league table**](/leagues/england-premier-league) shows
Chelsea now in 5th place, behind Spurs by a narrow margin.

The reason is that Chelsea have played a relatively easy set of fixtures. 
Or, in other words, that their remaining 
fixture list up to the end of this season
is a relatively tough one (compared with some 
other clubs, including Spurs).

This snapshot of [Chelsea's current schedule-strength chart](/leagues/england-premier-league/schedule-strength-Che) shows a
clear drift leftwards --- that is to say, 
in the direction of easier-than-average
fixtures --- since the halfway point of the season. Chelsea's current
schedule strength is &minus;0.8 league points. The schedule-strength 
difference between
Chelsea and Spurs --- whose schedule is rated as currently slightly 
_harder_ than average, at +0.4 points --- is therefore 1.2 points,
enough to cause their positions to be reversed in the 
[_alt-3_ table](/leagues/england-premier-league).
