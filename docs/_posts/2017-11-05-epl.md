After today's win over Manchester United, Chelsea move up to second place
in the 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league).

Why? Because Chelsea face a relatively easy run of fixtures up to the 
halfway point of the Premier League season.  Apart from their away match against Liverpool
in 3 weeks' time, their fixture list looks like a canter into 2018.  Chelsea's
upcoming schedule includes Swansea, Newcastle and Southampton at home, and West Ham away.

Man Utd, on the other hand, will face Watford and Arsenal away in the next few weeks, before they play Manchester City at Old Trafford in mid-December.

This contrast between United's and Chelsea's fixture lists comes out clearly in their current *alt-3 schedule strengths*: Chelsea are currently rated at schedule strength +1.4, while
United's relatively easy schedule to date makes their *alt-3* 
schedule strength appreciably lower at &minus;1.0. 
That difference counts for 2.4 league points in the *alt-3* table, 
putting Chelsea currently ahead of United by 1.4 points.
