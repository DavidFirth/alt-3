I never thought I'd be asking this question. But the coronavirus 
pandemic seems to be making all of us think a bit differently at present.

A friend of mine --- statistics professor at another university (and
a Man Utd fan, but still we're friends!) --- said this to me a couple of days
ago: 
> **This seems an ideal use of your ranking method.**

That was immediately after this news from Italy: 
[Coronavirus: Serie A season may not be concluded says Italian football federation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51824172). 
Since then, there has been discussion of 
whether to cancel football matches in other countries too.

My first reaction to that suggestion from my friend was to dismiss it as 
fantasy: surely there must be a better way to decide who wins the league, 
who gets relegated, etc., in the event that the full season's fixture
list cannot be completed. Surely even matches played behind closed doors 
would be better than just stopping the season at some arbitrary point
and using the league table --- whether it's the official league table
or the (better!) _alt-3_ table --- to determine the season's ultimate 
outcomes.

But now it's starting to look as though even the possibility of 
finishing the season without spectators could be in doubt.

So I got to thinking a bit about the idea of using the current
league table to decide things. In some sense, that would be fair.
But some clubs might reasonably complain, perhaps, that current
points totals disadvantage them, because they would have faced
a relatively easy run-in (having played all the strongest teams
in the league already, perhaps). 

That's where the _alt-3_ method comes into its own. 
It provides a mathematically
principled way to order the teams at any point during the season, in such
a way that:
- strength of opponents already faced, and home advantage, are coherently
accounted for;
- there is perfect agreement with the official league table whenever
there is no imbalance between teams in their fixture schedules ---
as is always the case at the end of a full season, after every team has
played every other team at home and away.

So indeed (as my friend suggested)
the _alt-3_ table _could_ reasonably be used as a fairer basis
than the official league table, in the event that final standings need to
be decided before all matches have been played.

Still there would be worries, I reckon, about using (fairly advanced)
mathematics to determine league outcomes that affect many people and 
a whole lot of commercial interests. Until such a time
(which does exist in my dreams!) as _alt-3_ becomes embodied in 
football league rules as the
accepted way to settle an unfinished fixture list --- in much 
the same way that 
the Duckworth-Lewis method became part of cricket's rules ---
I would be nervous about the use of _alt-3_ for that purpose.

**But here's the thing.** It just so happens that **right now
the official standings and the _alt-3_ standings, at the top and bottom
of all eight leagues currently covered by 
[alt-3.uk](https://alt-3.uk/leagues), are in perfect agreement**.
That applies to the 
[Premier League](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/england-premier-league) and 
[Championship](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/england-championship) in England,
to [Serie A](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/italy-serie-a) in Italy, 
to the German [Bundesliga](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/germany-bundesliga-1), 
Spanish [La Liga](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/spain-la-liga-primera),
French [Ligue 1](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/france-ligue-1), 
Dutch [Eredivisie](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/netherlands-eredivisie) 
and Portugal's [Primeira Liga](https://alt-3.uk/leagues/portugal-primeira-liga).

That is actually quite remarkable, to find that there is _no_ schedule
imbalance of any consequence, at the top or bottom of _any_ of the 
major leagues across Europe just now! It is most unexpected. For example,
even as recently as a couple of weeks ago there was [substantial imbalance
around the relegation zone in the _Premier League_](https://alt-3.uk/2020/02/25/epl/). And the last time I made a blog post about _Serie A_, it was
to say that [Juventus were really top, despite being placed 2nd at that 
time in
the official table](https://alt-3.uk/2020/02/10/three-new-leagues-added-to-alt3/).  But all such imbalance has evaporated, for the time being --- 
and this applies to all 8 of the listed leagues!

The conclusion? **As things stand right now, it could reasonably
be regarded as fair to use the official league table standings** 
to determine who wins each league, and who gets relegated.
