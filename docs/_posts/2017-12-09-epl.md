West Ham's win over Chelsea today, coupled with West Brom's defeat to fellow 
strugglers Swansea,
leaves the two clubs level on 13 points in the official league table --- with West Brom 
ranked just ahead in the official table, due to their slightly less awful goal difference.

But the two clubs' *alt-3* schedule-strength ratings tell a different story: the Hammers 
have faced an appreciably more harder fixture list up to the present date than
have Albion. 
In the mathematically principled 
[*alt-3* league table](/leagues/england-premier-league), then, West Brom are in
18th place, below West Ham, and clearly now among this season's relegation candidates
unless things improve soon for the midlands club.

The reason becomes clear just from a look at the two clubs' remaining fixtures
up to the halfway point of the season. West Ham will face Arsenal (H), Stoke (A) and
Newcastle (H); while West Brom have a much tougher next 3 fixtures, with matches 
against Liverpool (A) and Manchester United (H) as well as Stoke (A).  The *alt-3*
table takes proper account of that difference between the two clubs' match schedules.
