I am working hard towards a few enhancements of _alt-3_ for the new
   football season.
The results of that work will show up here soon!

I plan that the first _alt-3_ table of the new
    Premier League season will appear here on Tuesday 2nd October.
    At that point, 7 matches will have been played by each team ---
    so there will be enough information by then to make a meaningful
    schedule-strength adjustment to the official league table.

Once the new enhancements are fully online for the Premier League, the
     next phase of development here will be to add some more leagues.
     I have in mind initially
     the English second division (the _Championship_)
     and Italy's _Serie A_ as the next leagues to be added. 

When the new stuff appears, I'll be sure to post about it on Twitter.
