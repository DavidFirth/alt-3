  - text: At *alt-3.uk* we provide better league tables, for some of the most prominent football (soccer) leagues.  
  - text: The tables given here are better because, during the football season, they are usually **more informative** than the standard kind of league table based on accumulated points to date.
  - text: For the mathematics behind this, and for other background information, please follow the [**About alt-3.uk**](about) link.
