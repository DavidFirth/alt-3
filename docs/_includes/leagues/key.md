## Key:

* The usual league-table summaries:
  - **Pld:** matches played to date
  - **GD:** goal difference
  - **Pts:** league points accumulated to date
* The *alt-3* league table:
  - **_sched_:** the *alt-3* measure of each team's *schedule strength* to date.  Numbers greater than zero appear for teams that have played tougher opposition than average and/or have played fewer matches at home than away; and vice-versa for numbers less than zero. 
  - **Pts\|7:** the adjusted points total based on 7 matches played.  This is simply the league points accumulated to date, adjusted for schedule strength:
<center>            Pts|7 = Pts + sched  </center>  
<!-- [Where a team has one or more matches in hand, i.e., has played fewer than 7 matches, the *Pts|7* total will include also the team's projected points per match for the 'missing' match result(s).] -->
