## Key:

* The usual league-table summaries:
  - **M:** matches played to date
  - **GD:** goal difference
  - **P:** league points to date
* The *alt-3* ranking scores, expressed in two different ways 
(the ranking is the same from either):
  - **_s_:** the current values of team strength *s*, in the *alt-3* calculation (an *average* strength is 1)
  - **aP/M:** adjusted points per match (or '*alt-3* points per match')
* The *alt-3* measure of *schedule strength* for each team:
  - **sched:** an *average* schedule strength is 0; a positive value indicates
a more difficult schedule (i.e., the matches already played have been harder
than average); and negative indicates an easier schedule.

mathematically inclined reader) [The mathematical method explained](/about/the-maths/).
