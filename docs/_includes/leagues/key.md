## Key:

* The usual league-table summaries:
  - **Pld:** matches played to date
  - **GD:** goal difference
  - **Pts:** league points to date
* The *alt-3* ranking scores, expressed in two different ways (the ranking is the same from either):
  - **_a_:** the current values of *a*, in the *alt-3* calculation
  - **aP/M:** adjusted points per match (or '*alt-3* points per match', or 'points per match according to today's values of *a*')
  
Also give the values of the draw and home-advantage parameters.

Maybe show schedule strength in place of *a*?
