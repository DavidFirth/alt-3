## Key:

The league-table **rankings** are shown in the centre of the table, with the **_alt-3_ league position in bold** to the right, and the more standard league-table position (based on points already in the bag, with goal-difference to resolve ties where needed) shown in the grey section of the table, to the left.

Unless you have a very narrow web-browser window, or a very old web browser, you should also see up- or down-arrows to indicate where teams are higher or lower in the *alt-3* table than in the standard table. A solid arrow <img src="/assets/images/up2.svg" width="15"> or <img src="/assets/images/down2.svg" width="15"> indicates a difference of 3 or more league places.

The other numbers shown in the table are:

<ul>
	<li>The usual league-table summaries:
        <ul>
		<li><b>Pld:</b> matches played to date</li>
        <li><b>GD:</b> goal difference</li>
        <li><b>Pts:</b> league points accumulated to date</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>The <b><i>alt-3</i></b> league table:
        <ul>
		<li><b>sched:</b> the <i>alt-3</i> measure of each team's <i>schedule strength</i> to date.  Numbers greater than zero appear for teams that have played tougher opposition than average and/or have played fewer matches at home than away; and vice-versa for numbers less than zero.</li> 
        <li><b>Pts|9:</b> the adjusted points total based on 9 matches played.  This is normally &mdash; unless a team has one or more <i>games in hand</i> &mdash; the league points accumulated to date, adjusted for schedule strength:
<center>         <b>   Pts|9 = Pts + sched </b> </center>
[Where a team has one or more <i>games in hand</i>, i.e., has played fewer than 9 matches, the Pts|9 total accounts coherently for that by including additional points for each game in hand.]</li></ul></li>
	</ul>
