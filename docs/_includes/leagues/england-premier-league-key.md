## Key:

* The usual league-table summaries:
  - **Pld:** matches played to date
  - **GD:** goal difference
  - **Pts:** league points accumulated to date
* The *alt-3* league table:
  - **sched:** the *alt-3* measure of each team's *schedule strength* to date.  Numbers greater than zero appear for teams that have played tougher opposition than average and/or have played fewer matches at home than away; and vice-versa for numbers less than zero. 
  - **Pts\|8:** the adjusted points total based on 8 matches played.  This is normally --- unless a team has one or more *games in hand* --- the league points accumulated to date, adjusted for schedule strength:
<center>            Pts|8 = Pts + sched  </center>

<br>
[Where a team has one or more *games in hand*, i.e., has played fewer than 8 matches, the Pts|8 total allows for that coherently by including additional points for each game in hand.]
