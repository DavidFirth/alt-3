**Still in early development, and not yet published as a website.**

The purpose of this repository is to host the public "alt-3" web pages, where alternative league tables are presented for professional football (soccer).

For the league tables, the methodology behind them, and other related information, please visit the website:  https://davidfirth.github.io/alt-3
